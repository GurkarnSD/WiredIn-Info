# WiredIn

## Introduction
Welcome to WiredIn, the Platform For Developers by Developers. WiredIn was created as a tool for developers to connect, share ideas, learn, and collaborate on projects. As a student developer, I understand the struggle of starting and growing a project into what you envision. Through the WiredIn platform, developers can find others to collaborate on their projects and develop their knowledge.

## Features
WiredIn offers several features to facilitate collaboration and learning among developers:
- **Profile Page**: Users can create and customize their profiles to showcase their skills, projects, and experiences.
- **Feed**: Stay updated with the latest posts, projects, and discussions from developers you follow.
- **Contracts**: Collaborate with other developers by creating contracts outlining project details, deadlines, and contributions.
- **Jobs**: Find freelance or full-time job opportunities tailored for developers.
- **Messaging**: Communicate with other developers privately to discuss projects, share ideas, or ask for help.
